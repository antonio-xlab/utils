# Script which deletes all but the latest N images from each repository under an Azure Container Registry.
# Supports dry-runs (i.e no actual deletions of Azure resources is done).
#
# USAGE
# Format: sh az_cr_cleanup_script.sh <ARG_DRY_RUN> <ARG_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_NAME> <ARG_KEEP_N_LATEST>
# Examples: sh az_cr_cleanup_script.sh 1 moonstonedevacr 3
#			sh az_cr_cleanup_script.sh 1 moonstonedevacr 3 borderforce,borderforce_webapp,borderforce_worker
#			sh az_cr_cleanup_script.sh 0 moonstonedevacr 3
#			sh az_cr_cleanup_script.sh 0 moonstonedevacr 3 labgnostic-processor,labgnostic-lab2lab
